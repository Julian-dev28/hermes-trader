# Hermes-Trader
> Autonomous multi-market trading agent for Hyperliquid — crypto perps, equity perps (TSLA, NVDA, AAPL), and commodities (NATGAS, SILVER, COPPER). A standalone Python system built with FastAPI and OpenRouter, operated by [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) through an MCP server.

**What it does:** Scans every Hyperliquid market (500+ perps + spot), fires statistical triggers on price/volume/breakout signals, runs a cheap pre-AI technical analysis filter, and only calls AI on CONFIRMED setups. Executes real trades with DSL-managed dynamic exits — no human in the loop.

---

## CLI Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start autonomous trading loop (background)
python3 scripts/trading_loop.py --env prod --daemon

# 2. Start dashboard + API server
python3 -m hermes_trader.server
# or: python3 -m uvicorn hermes_trader.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# 3. Monitor
python3 scripts/status.py
```

Dashboard served at `http://localhost:8000` (port from `HERMES_PORT`).

### Paper trading (no keys, no funds)

Set `"mode": "PAPER"` in `.agent-config.json` and start the loop normally. The
full pipeline runs against **live market data** — scans, AI research, risk
gates, DSL exits — but every order is filled by a simulated book
(`hermes_trader/client/paper_engine.py`): fills at the live L2 touch plus
`paper_slippage_bps`, taker fees at `paper_fee_bps`, virtual SL/TP triggers
evaluated against live mids, state persisted to `.paper-state.json` across
restarts. No `HYPERLIQUID_*` env vars required. Limitations: orders always
fill in full (no partial fills / book-depth exhaustion) and triggers fill at
their trigger price — real markets gap. Graduate to `LIVE` only after the
paper book has survived long enough to trust the configuration.

---

## The problem it solves

Trading signals appear constantly — 5-minute spikes, hourly trends, daily breakouts. Most systems call expensive AI on every signal, burning tokens on noise. Hermes-Trader solves this by separating cheap statistical analysis from expensive AI reasoning:

1. **Scan** — 500+ markets in parallel with volume pre-filtering and rate-limit-aware batching
2. **TA Filter** — multi-timeframe indicators (EMA, RSI, ATR, ADX, volume) — zero AI cost
3. **AI Research** — only on CONFIRMED signals, plus any fired momentum burst
4. **Execution** — Kelly-sized orders with DSL dynamic stop-loss exits (loss protection → profit locking)
5. **Discovery** — built-in Hyperfeed Discovery replicates Smart Money leaderboards and whale signals

This architecture reduced daily AI costs from $8-$52 to $3-$10 while improving signal quality.

## Key Features

### Rate-Limit-Aware Scan Pipeline
- **Volume pre-filtering**: Top-N markets by 24h notional volume (default 50)
- **Parallel batch scanning**: Workers fan out within batches, sleep between
- **TTL caching**: Candles cached 15 minutes, 4-scan cost ≈ 600 weight (vs. 10,000+ raw)
- **Configurable**: `HERMES_SCAN_INTERVAL`, `HERMES_MAX_MARKETS`, `HERMES_BATCH_SIZE`, `HERMES_BATCH_SLEEP`

### DSL (Dynamic Stop-Loss) Exit Engine
- **Phase 1 — Loss Protection**: Hard stop at `max_loss_pct` below entry (default 2.5%)
- **Phase 2 — Profit Locking**: Activated once price moves `protect_pct` (1.5%) in your favor — trailing floor at `entry + (peak − entry) × (1 − retrace)`; retrace tightens by tier (30% @ +5%, 40% @ +10%, 50% @ +20%, 60% @ +50%); floor ratchets one-way and never gives back locked profit
- **Hard timeout**: Emergency exit after `hard_timeout_minutes` (180 min default), regardless of PnL
- **Auto-registration**: Every executed position is registered for DSL tracking
- **Persisted across restarts**: Tracker state (peak, floor, breach counter) is written to `.dsl-state.json` on every advance, so a daemon restart doesn't reset the ratchet
- **Exchange reconciliation**: Each scan tick, trackers are reconciled with live exchange positions — manually-opened or externally-closed positions stay in sync; positions opened before the engine shipped are synthesized from `entryPx`
- **Auto-close**: When a tick trips a floor/stop/timeout, the trading loop market-closes the position and logs a `dsl_exit` event to the session log. No human in the loop

### Risk & Resilience Gates
- **Regime-aware gating**: trades are scored against the BTC/ETH trend regime — aligned trades clear at `aligned_min_conf`, counter-regime trades need `counter_regime_min_conf`. `block_counter_trend_bypass` stops the force-execute path from sneaking longs into a downtrend.
- **Short-specific liquidity floor**: shorts require deeper 24h volume (`min_short_volume_usd`) than longs — thin markets squeeze.
- **Free-margin floor**: `min_available_margin_pct` blocks new entries once free margin gets thin, capping over-leverage and correlated stacking.
- **Correlation cap**: `max_crypto_long_correlated` limits simultaneous correlated crypto exposure.
- **Self-healing watchdog**: the loop re-execs itself if a scan cycle hangs; the watchdog is armed *before* startup network I/O so it also covers startup hangs.
- **Partial-dex degraded-read guard**: a HIP-3 dex that fails to fetch no longer drops its equity from the aggregate — prevents false "huge loss" reads from poisoning memory or tripping the kill switch.
- **Re-entry backstop**: a DSL-registry check prevents position stacking when a live read flakes (restart / 429 window).

### Hyperfeed Discovery (Native, no MCP)
Replicates the Hyperfeed MCP plugin's data directly from HL API:
- `leaderboard_get_markets(limit)` — top markets by OI + volume
- `market_get_funding_regime()` — LONG_CROWDED / SHORT_CROWDED / NEUTRAL analysis
- `smart_money_concentration()` — identifies assets with whale accumulation
- `oi_funding_anomaly()` — OI spike + negative funding + flat price = accumulation signal
- `discovery_get_top_traders(...)` — trader rankings with win rates
- `market_get_asset_data(asset)` — candles + funding + OI for any coin

## Configuration

There are two places to configure hermes-trader: **`.env.local`** (credentials,
API, runtime/infra — process-level, read at startup) and **`.agent-config.json`**
(trading behaviour and risk — read fresh on every trade, no restart needed). Both
are gitignored.

### `.env.local` — credentials & runtime

Copy `.env.local.example` → `.env.local` and fill in:

```bash
# ── OpenRouter (AI research) ─────────────────────────────────
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...your-key      # required
OPENROUTER_MODEL=x-ai/grok-4.3            # optional — this is the default

# ── Hyperliquid ──────────────────────────────────────────────
HYPERLIQUID_WALLET_ADDRESS=0x...          # required — the signing (agent) wallet
HYPERLIQUID_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...             # required — that wallet's key
# HYPERLIQUID_MASTER_ADDRESS=0x...        # optional — set for an agent-wallet
#                                           setup; the master holds the funds

# ── News (optional) ──────────────────────────────────────────
# BRAVE_API_KEY=BSA...                    # optional — enables news headlines
#   in AI research and the news-blackout risk gate. Without it, research runs
#   with news_context = "no news" and that gate is inert.

# ── Scan tuning (optional — defaults shown) ──────────────────
HERMES_SCAN_INTERVAL=60        # seconds between scan cycles
HERMES_MAX_MARKETS=60          # total candle-fetch budget per scan
HERMES_MAX_MARKETS_HIP3=25     # of that budget, slots reserved for HIP-3
HERMES_BATCH_SIZE=20           # markets per parallel batch
HERMES_BATCH_SLEEP=0.3         # seconds between batches
# HERMES_PORT=8000             # FastAPI server port
```

Keep `HERMES_MAX_MARKETS ≤ HERMES_SCAN_INTERVAL` — see [Rate Limit Math](#rate-limit-math).

When `enable_hip3=true`, the budget splits into `(HERMES_MAX_MARKETS - HERMES_MAX_MARKETS_HIP3)` crypto slots + `HERMES_MAX_MARKETS_HIP3` HIP-3 slots, each sorted by 24h volume independently. Without this split, BTC/ETH/SOL/etc. dominate the single sorted list and tokenized-equity perps (e.g. `xyz:CRCL` $34M, `xyz:DRAM` $22M) never get candles fetched — so their +20% / −8% swings never surface a signal.

### `.agent-config.json` — trading behaviour & risk

The live trading knobs. Read fresh on **every trade**, so edits take effect on the
next cycle — no restart. Keys are read tolerantly: `snake_case` or `camelCase`
both resolve (`max_trade_notional_usd` ≡ `maxTradeNotionalUsd`).

```json
{
  "mode": "LIVE",
  "equity_fraction_per_trade": 0.28,
  "leverage": 15,
  "min_ai_confidence": 0.78,
  "max_concurrent": 6,
  "max_trade_notional_usd": 100000,
  "max_total_notional_pct": 40.0,
  "max_daily_loss_usd": -300,
  "min_available_margin_pct": 0.05,
  "min_market_volume_usd": 800000,
  "min_short_volume_usd": 50000000,
  "cooldown_min": 60,
  "counter_regime_min_conf": 0.8,
  "aligned_min_conf": 0.7,
  "block_counter_trend_bypass": true,
  "whale_scan_bypass": true,
  "max_crypto_long_correlated": 8,
  "coin_allowlist": [],
  "coin_blocklist": []
}
```

| Key | What it does | Default |
|-----|--------------|---------|
| `mode` | `OFF` = analyse only, no orders · `PAPER` = simulated fills against live prices, no keys needed · `LIVE` = place real orders | `OFF` |
| `paper_starting_equity` | PAPER mode: virtual starting balance (USD) | `10000` |
| `paper_fee_bps` | PAPER mode: taker fee charged per side, in bps | `4.5` |
| `paper_slippage_bps` | PAPER mode: slippage applied past the live touch on fills | `2` |
| `equity_fraction_per_trade` | Fraction of perp equity committed as margin per trade — see [Trade Sizing](#trade-sizing) | `0.01` |
| `leverage` | Leverage **ceiling** — each trade uses `min(this, the coin's own max)`. Coin maxes differ (BOME 3×, BTC 40×). Set high (e.g. 40) to ride each coin's max. Also multiplies position notional. | `5` |
| `min_ai_confidence` | Minimum AI confidence for a LONG/SHORT to execute | `0.8` |
| `max_concurrent` | Max simultaneous open positions | `3` |
| `max_trade_notional_usd` | Hard ceiling on a single trade's notional | `200` |
| `max_total_notional_pct` | Ceiling on combined open notional, as a multiple of equity | `1.0` |
| `max_daily_loss_usd` | Daily-loss kill switch (negative number) | `-100` |
| `daily_giveback_halt_pct` | **Give-back breaker**: once the day peaks ≥ `daily_giveback_min_peak_usd`, halt NEW entries if it retraces more than this from peak (existing positions ride their stops; resets at UTC roll). Locks green days from round-tripping | `0` (off) |
| `daily_giveback_min_peak_usd` | Arm threshold for the give-back breaker — stays disarmed until the day's peak PnL reaches this | `20` |
| `tp_scale_fraction` | Fraction auto-banked at the TP target (server-side reduce-only trigger at ~1 ATR); rest rides the trail. Captures profit instead of round-tripping | `0.5` |
| `crowded_with_min_conf` | **Squeeze caution**: a with-the-crowd aligned trade (short into `SHORT_CROWDED` / long into `LONG_CROWDED`) must clear this conf or it's blocked `via:crowded_squeeze` | `0` (off) |
| `min_available_margin_pct` | Block new trades when free margin drops below this fraction of equity — caps over-leverage/stacking. Lower = deploys more aggressively | `0.10` |
| `min_market_volume_usd` | Skip markets below this 24h volume | `5_000_000` |
| `min_short_volume_usd` | Extra 24h-volume floor for **shorts only** — thin markets squeeze, so shorts need deeper liquidity | `0` |
| `cooldown_min` | Minutes before re-trading the same coin | `60` |
| `counter_regime_min_conf` | Confidence bar for a trade **against** the regime (e.g. long in a downtrend) | `0.7` |
| `aligned_min_conf` | Confidence bar for a trade **with** the regime (trend-aligned) — typically lower than the counter-regime bar | _unset_ |
| `block_counter_trend_bypass` | When `true`, the slow-burn/force-execute path can't bypass the counter-regime gate — stops long-into-downtrend bleed | `false` |
| `whale_scan_bypass` | Let whale-accumulation signals bypass the scan gate so they reach research/execution | `false` |
| `max_crypto_long_correlated` | Cap on simultaneous correlated crypto positions (concentration guard) | `2` |
| `coin_allowlist` | If non-empty, **only** these coins are tradeable | `[]` (all) |
| `coin_blocklist` | Coins that are never traded | `[]` |

Optional nested `dsl_exit` block tunes the trailing-stop engine —
`max_loss_pct` (2.5), `protect_pct` (1.5), `retrace_threshold` (0.30),
`hard_timeout_minutes` (180). Tracker state persists to `.dsl-state.json` at the
repo root (override with `HERMES_DSL_STATE_FILE`); positions opened before the
auto-close pass shipped are picked up automatically from the exchange.

Trigger internals (weights, sigma thresholds, candle interval) live separately in
`hermes_trader/agents/config.py` — edit there to tune the scan itself.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Hyperliquid wallet with private key
- OpenRouter API key ([openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai))
- (Optional) Brave Search API key for news

### Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Julian-dev28/hermes-trader
cd hermes-trader

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (editable, with dev extras: pytest + ruff)
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Configure
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your keys
```

## Running

### API Server (Optional)
```bash
# Start the FastAPI server (port 8000)
python -m hermes_trader.server

# Or use uvicorn directly:
uvicorn hermes_trader.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
The API is available at `http://localhost:8000`. Health check: `GET /` returns `{"service": "Hermes-Trader", "version": "0.3.0", "status": "running"}`.

### Continuous Trading Loop (Recommended)
```bash
# Start the autonomous trading loop (scans every 60s)
python scripts/trading_loop.py

# Or run in background:
nohup python scripts/trading_loop.py > /tmp/hermes-trader.log 2>&1 &
```
Monitor logs: `tail -f /tmp/hermes-trader.log`

**Trading Loop Behavior:**
- Scans top 60 markets every 60 seconds
- Each tick, reconciles DSL trackers with live exchange positions and runs an exit pass — market-closes anything whose dynamic floor, hard stop, or timeout has tripped
- Runs the TA filter on each trigger — only CONFIRMED signals (or fired momentum bursts) reach AI research
- Researches qualifying signals with AI (qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b)
- Executes trades that clear all 11 risk gates
- Runs continuously until stopped

---

## Testing

```bash
pytest                          # offline unit tests — fast, no network, CI-safe
pytest -m online                # read-only tests against the live Hyperliquid public API
HERMES_E2E=1 pytest -m live      # real-money e2e: places a tiny order, calls the LLM
```

`online` and `live` tests are deselected by default. The `live` suite spends
real funds (a ~$14 round-trip order plus a billable OpenRouter call) and is
additionally gated behind `HERMES_E2E=1` so it can never run by accident.

---

## MCP Integration

hermes-trader is a standalone Python application; **Hermes Agent operates it through this MCP server** — that is the whole integration boundary. The agent calls the tools below; the trading engine itself has no Hermes-framework dependency.

The MCP server (`scripts/hermes-mcp-server.py`) exposes 100 tools over stdio transport. The 14 primary tools are listed below; the remainder are Hyperliquid data passthroughs (some are placeholders pending SDK wiring).

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Trading Core** | |
| `scan` | Scan all HL markets (volume-filtered), return triggered candidates |
| `research` | Deep AI analysis on a coin with OpenRouter |
| `execute` | Execute trade through risk gates + DSL registration |
| `state` | Get full agent state (mode, equity, positions, trades) |
| `config` | Get/set agent configuration (mode, risk caps, thresholds) |
| **Hyperfeed Discovery** | |
| `leaderboard_get_markets` | Top markets by OI + volume |
| `leaderboard_get_top_traders` | Trader rankings with win rates |
| `leaderboard_get_trader_positions` | Positions for a specific trader |
| `discovery_get_top_traders` | Discovery top traders (alias) |
| `discovery_get_trader_state` | Full trader state from discovery |
| **Market Data** | |
| `market_get_asset_data` | Candles + funding + OI for any coin |
| `market_get_funding_regime` | LONG_CROWDED / SHORT_CROWDED / NEUTRAL |
| `market_list_instruments` | All tradeable instruments |
| `market_get_mids` | Real-time mid prices |

Configure in Hermes Agent's `config.yaml`:
```yaml
mcp_servers:
  hermes-trader:
    command: python3
    args:
      - /path/to/hermes-trader/scripts/hermes-mcp-server.py
    cwd: /path/to/hermes-trader
    timeout: 60
    env:
      OPENROUTER_API_KEY: ${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}
```

---

## Operating via Hermes Agent

With the skill loaded and the MCP server registered (see [MCP Integration](#mcp-integration)),
you operate hermes-trader by prompting your Hermes Agent in plain language — the agent
calls the MCP tools for you. Restart your Hermes session first so the skill and MCP
server are picked up.

| Goal | Prompt to give Hermes |
|------|-----------------------|
| **Check state** | *Load the hermes-trader skill and show me its current state — mode, equity, open positions, recent trades.* |
| **Configure** (`OFF` analyzes only, `LIVE` places real orders) | *Set hermes-trader to LIVE mode with a max trade size of $20.* |
| **Scan** | *Scan the markets with hermes-trader and list what triggered, with composite scores.* |
| **Research** | *Research the top candidate and tell me the verdict, side, and confidence.* |
| **Run one full cycle** | *Run a hermes-trader cycle: scan, run the TA filter, research the best candidate, and execute it if the verdict is LONG or SHORT. Tell me what happened.* |
| **Start continuous trading** | *Start the hermes-trader trading loop in the background, then confirm it is running.* |
| **Stop continuous trading** | *Stop the hermes-trader trading loop.* |
| **Monitor (in session)** | *Check hermes-trader's status and tell me if anything changed since the last report.* |

"Start continuous trading" runs `python scripts/trading_loop.py`, which scans ->
TA-filters -> researches -> executes on its own every `HERMES_SCAN_INTERVAL`
seconds, independent of the Hermes session.

For **hands-off monitoring**, resume the hourly status cron job (zero AI cost — it
just runs `status.py`; see [`references/cron-jobs.md`](skills/hermes-trader-agent/references/cron-jobs.md)):
```bash
hermes cron list            # find the "Hermes Trader Hourly Report" job id
hermes cron resume <job-id> # start hourly status delivery
```

---

## Trade Sizing

Every trade's position size comes from one formula in `executor.py`:

```
trade_notional = perp_equity  ×  equity_fraction_per_trade  ×  leverage
```

Both knobs live in `.agent-config.json`:

| Key | Meaning | Example |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `equity_fraction_per_trade` | Fraction of **total perp equity** committed as margin per trade | `0.10` = 10% |
| `leverage` | Leverage ceiling — each trade uses `min(this, coin's own max)`; pushed to the exchange via `set_leverage` | `10` = up to 10× |

Sizing keys off **total perp equity**, not free margin — so each trade commits a
*fixed* amount and `N` trades scales the account fully in. With
`equity_fraction_per_trade: 0.10`, every trade commits 10% of equity as margin,
so ~10 trades deploys the whole account linearly. (Sizing off *free* margin
instead would decay geometrically and never fully deploy.)

Caps that bound it: `maxConcurrent` (max simultaneous positions — set it ≥ the
number of trades you want open at once), `max_total_notional_pct` (ceiling on
combined open notional as a multiple of equity — at 10× leverage, `10.0` ≈ fully
deployed), and `maxTradeNotionalUsd` (hard ceiling on a single trade's notional).
Config keys are read tolerantly — `snake_case` or `camelCase` both work.

Defaults if the keys are absent: `equity_fraction_per_trade = 0.01`, `leverage = 5`.

---

## Design Decisions

### Why volume pre-filtering?
HL's API rate limit is **1200 weight/minute**. A single candle fetch costs **weight 20**. Scanning all 500+ markets naively requires 10,000+ weight → instant 429. Volume pre-filtering to the top 60 markets keeps a scan at ~1,200 weight. Sustained usage is `1200 × markets ÷ interval` weight/min, so the safe rule is **markets ≤ scan-interval-in-seconds** (the default 60/60 sits right at the limit's edge).

### Why DSL exit engine?
Static SL/TP orders don't adapt to price action. The DSL engine implements a two-phase design: Phase 1 protects your capital (hard stop), Phase 2 locks in profits (trailing floor with tiered retrace thresholds). The floor only moves up — it never gives back locked profit. State is persisted on disk so a daemon restart doesn't reset the ratchet, and the registry is reconciled against the exchange each tick so manually-opened or externally-closed positions stay coherent. This pattern is inspired by senpi-skills' DSL dynamic stop-loss engine.

### Why Hyperfeed Discovery?
The HL leaderboard and whale tracking aren't exposed through the public API. This module reconstructs the same data patterns (leaderboard rankings, smart money concentration, OI anomalies) from the raw HL endpoints we already call. No external MCP dependency needed.

### Why pure Python?
Rewritten from TypeScript/Next.js to enable simpler deployment, MCP integration with Hermes Agent, and native testability without a headless browser.

With `HERMES_MAX_MARKETS=60` and a 50s candle-cache TTL, each 60s scan fetches fresh candles (~1,200 weight). The cache TTL is deliberately kept just below the scan interval so the scanner never reacts to a stale snapshot — raising it would re-introduce that lag.

The crypto/HIP-3 budget split (`HERMES_MAX_MARKETS_HIP3`, default 25) is a *partition* of the same 60-slot budget, not extra calls — total candle weight stays at ~1,200/scan regardless of how the split is tuned.

When HIP-3 is enabled, `fetch_account_state(user, include_hip3=True)` issues one extra `clearinghouseState` POST per registered HIP-3 dex (~8 dexes × weight 2 = ~16 weight). The aggregated path is used by the dashboard, the trading-loop heartbeat, and the MCP `state`/`portfolio`/`close` handlers; the executor's sizing path stays main-only so free-margin checks aren't fooled by cross-dex idle USDC.

## Built With

- FastAPI — Python web framework
- OpenRouter (Qwen3-235B-A22B) — AI research pipeline
- Hyperliquid Python SDK — perpetual futures DEX
- Brave Search API (optional, for news signals)
- Prometheus (`prometheus-client`) — `/metrics` instrumentation + observability
- Kubernetes (kind + kube-prometheus-stack) — local deployment & Grafana dashboards (see [`k8s/`](k8s/README.md))

It is **operated by** [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent)
through the MCP server — Hermes Agent is not a build dependency; the trading
engine is plain Python.

**Note:** Project trunk is `main` (Python). The legacy TypeScript/Next.js implementation lives on archived branches.
